title: MCI reversion prediciton with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaigng Initiative databse
---

In the project, we plan to build and evaluate classification models to predict reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years (a binary outcome) using the ADNI (Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database. We downloaded demographic, clinical, genetic, imaging, and biomarker data from the ADNI website. MCI reversion is defined as reverting back to normal cognition after being diagnosed with MCI. The  definition used by ADNI was based on the following criteria: (1) subjective memory complaint; (2) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30; (3) global Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5; (4) abnormal memory function; (5) did not meet AD criteria for deterioration in general cognitive and functional performance. After exclusion, 185 subjects from the ADNI1 phase who had a MCI diagnosis at baseline were selected for analysis.
