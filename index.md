title: Predictive modeling for MCI reversion using ALzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database
---

In the project, we plan to build and evaluate classification models to predict reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years (a binary outcome) using the ADNI (Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database.
