Problem Statement and Motivation: 
In the current project, we plan to build and evaluate classification models to predict reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years using the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database. MCI is defined as a transitional state between normal cognition and dementia. Much of the existing literature has aimed to determine the predictors of conversion from MCI to dementia, however, many MCI patients do not progress to AD and up to 55% revert back to a cognitively normal state. It is therefore crucial to identify important predictors of a good prognosis among patients with MCI, which may inform intervention targets.

## 1. Introduction and Description of Data:
MCI, a high risk condition for dementia, is regarded as a transitional state between cognitive normal	and dementia. Prevalence of MCI reversion to normal has varied widely, ranging from 4 to 55%, and multiple explanations are proposed for this variability, including individuals being misclassified initially, having unstable MCI, and having true improvements in cognitive functioning upon follow-up. Identifying which individuals classified as MCI are more likely to revert could help optimise resource allocation among MCI patients, with those considered least likely to revert receiving greater levels of intervention and follow-up contact. Therefore, the aim of this project is to build predictive model for MCI reversion using a wide range of predictors including socio-demographic, clinical, genetic, imaging characteristics, and biospecimen biomarkers. 

The goal of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study is to track the progression of the disease over different disease stages. The study has three phases: ADNI 1 (five years), ADNI GO (two years), and ADNI 2 (five years). A total of 400 MCI patients were enrolled at the baseline of the ADNI 1 phase and 300 new MCI patients (including 150 early MCI and 150 late MCI) were enrolled at the baseline of the ADNI 2 phase. The definition of MCI used by ADNI was based on the following criteria: (1) subjective memory complaint; (2) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30; (3) global Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5; (4) abnormal memory function; (5) did not meet AD criteria for deterioration in general cognitive and functional performance. After exclusion, 400 MCI patients (187 for ADNI 1 and 213 for ADNI 2) that were followed for at least two years and did not develop AD within the time period were included for analyses.

## 2. Literature Review/Related Work: 
Conversion from MCI to cognitively normal (CN) is commonly observed in the population, and several explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed in the existing literature. It has been reported that patients who revert from MCI to CN, or MCI-reverters, may have a temporary decline in cognitive functioning due to poor mental health (e.g. depression or stress related conditions/disorders) (Kumar, 2006; Olazaran, 2011) or physical health (Wisotsky, 1965). Others have postulated that these unstable MCI states are mis-labeled as MCI, and are in fact pre-MCI conditions that only develop to stable MCI under certain conditions or exposures (Petersen, 2011). Furthermore, it is possible that there are true causes of MCI that are reversible, such as metabolic disorders or acute conditions (e.g. brain injury, substance abuse) that may improve over time, leading to subsequent reversion back to CN. Lastly, pharmacological interventions, lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity, and baseline health may be true predictors of a better MCI prognosis (Olazaran, 2011). 

While it is of great importance to understand which individuals with MCI have a favorable prognosis, the literature in this area is sparse. Some studies have reported that cognitive factors and other measures used to diagnose MCI are significantly associated with MCI reversion (Manly, 2008; Diniz, 2009; Loewenstein, 2009; Ganguli, 2011; Olazaran, 2011; Dolcos, 2012;  Koepsell, 2012; Park 2015). Of the few studies that examined non-diagnostic factors (e.g. sociodemographic characteristics; physical and mental health), some found that age, educational attainment, arthritis, mental activity, better vision and smelling ability, and blood pressure drop was associated with MCI reversion (Tokuchi, 2014; Sachdev, 2013), but others did not find any associations (Koepsell, 2012). To the best of our knowledge, no study has set out to develop a prediction algorithm for MCI reversion to CN. Identifying individuals with diagnosed MCI, who have a high likelihood of reverting back to normal cognition can: (1) avoid unnecessary antidementia treatments, where the individual is exposed to potential side effects and health risks; (2) prevent the enrollment of clinical trial subjects who may only be in a temporary phase of cognitive decline, and do not in fact have the target disease (Koepsell, 2012). 
			
After a thorough literature review, potential diagnostic and non-diagnostic predictors of MCI reversion to CN were chosen a priori for preliminary EDA and prediction modeling for MCI reversion at two years from baseline. These factors have previously been implicated in either MCI reversion or conversion, and include the following: 
<br>
<br>
**1) Demographic characteristics:** age, gender, ethnicity, race, education, and marital status;<br>
**2) Clinical factors:** baseline blood glucose level, homocysteine level, body mass index (BMI); history of stroke; history of hypertension (Sachdev, 2013);<br>
**3) Lifestyle factors:** baseline smoking, baseline alcohol abuse;<br>
**4) Neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments:** baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) scores, Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive 11-item/13-item progression model (ADAS), Animal Fluency Test, Trail Making Tests A and B, Clinical Dementia Rating score (CDR-SB), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (Ewer, 2012; Sachdev, 2013; Park, 2015). These tests assess different facets of cognitive performance, including daily functional ability, severity of cognitive impairment, verbal learning and fluency, and memory;<br>
**5) Neuroimaging biomarkers:** baseline fluorodeoxyglucose 18F uptake on brain positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Park, 2015);<br>
**6) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers:** baseline CSF amyloid-β 1 to 42 peptide (Aβ42), total tau, phosphorylated tau and APOE4 genotype (Sachdev, 2013; Thomas, 2017; Park, 2015).<br>

## 3. Modeling Approach and Project Trajectory: 
Data was split into 75% training set (N=300) and 25% test set (N=100). Classification models were built with the training set and compared with the baseline model of all 0’s classifier. MCI conversion to CN is a dichotomous response variable (0=stable MCI; 1=MCI-reversion to CN), and therefore only classification models that are appropriate for binary outcome were considered, including logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, and boosting classifier. Normalization was performed on the continuous predictors, and the optimal parameters for each of the classification models fitted were chosen using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. The proportion of MCI reversions in our sample was only 7.25%. Therefore, considering the unbalanced dataset, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated on the test set to assess the model performance. 

We had originally proposed to develop a machine learning model for predicting preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease. However, given the large number of post-baseline measures (including biomarkers and neuropsychological measures) required for the construction of the outcome definition, the sample that remained was too small for meaningful analysis. We therefore changed our outcome measure to MCI-reversion and aimed to develop machine learning solutions for predicting reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years. Since our preliminary report, we have additionally included participants from ADNI2 who had baseline MCI and a diagnostic classification at the 2-year follow-up, in order to maximize the power of our analysis. This increased our study population to N=400. We also considered ADNI GO participants, but since they did not have a follow-up at 2-years, we excluded them from the current analysis. Finally, some predictors measured at baseline in ADNI 1 were not collected at baseline in ADNI 2 (e.g. AVLT-Recognition, TMT-A, and TMT-B), and were therefore dropped from further analysis. 
 	
 				
## 4. Results, Conclusions, and Future Work: 
Preliminary EDA was conducted on pre-selected predictors. For continuous predictors, the probability of MCI reversing to normal was positively associated with homocysteine levels, baseline AVLT score, baseline animal fluency score, baseline beta-amyloid levels, baseline tau levels, and baseline phospho-tau levels, and negatively associated with age and baseline ADAS-cog/13 score. For binary/categorical predictors, females had a lower probability of MCI reversion as compared to males; widowed people had a lowest probability of MCI reversion, followed by married and divorced people. Increased copy of APOE4 allele was associated with lower probability of MCI reversion.

Among the six classification models, the AdaBoost classifier with optimal maximum depth of 2 and optimal number of trees of 16 has the highest TPR of 0.6 and the highest test AUC of 0.88. Therefore, the AdaBoost classifier was selected as our final model.

**Strengths**<br>
The current study has several strengths, including a large sample of participants with MCI at baseline, consideration of a diverse range of neuropsychological, demographic, clinical, and biomarker factors that were measured using standardized assessments and protocols, and consideration of multiple classification models including logistic regression, LDA, KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, and boosting classifier.

**Limitations**<br>
Our study has several limitations that should be considered in interpreting the results. First, the follow-up duration of two years was relatively short, therefore, the study time frame may have been insufficient to completely capture all MCI reversions to CN. Second, we restricted our analysis to those who had MCI at baseline, complete data on all predictors at baseline, and a follow-up diagnostic classification at the two-year follow-up. This may limit the generalizability of our results, if the individuals who were lost to follow-up were different from individuals remained in the analyses. Also, many predictors reported in previous studies had to be dropped from our modeling process due to a large number of missing values at baseline and/or lack of data collection in either ADNI 1 or ADNI 2, such as neuropsychological measures (including Trail Making Test and one measure of AVLT), diabetes, and neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire score (NPIQ). Finally, ADNI does not routinely collect information on important variables such as lifestyle factors (e.g. physical activity, diet), social interaction and/or support, and personality traits, which may be predictive of MCI reversion rates. 

**Future work**<br>
In light of the short-comings of the current study, we propose several methods that could have improved our project and possible extensions of the work. First, we had excluded from our models individuals who did not have complete data on baseline predictors, which largely reduced our final analytic sample size. Given a longer time frame, we would have performed imputation on those missing values, using a model-based approach. Second, we considered only predictors at baseline, and did not assess how measures of these predictors at other time points prior to the two year point or changes in these measures over time could improve the prediction accuracy. Using post-baseline measures that were taken prior to our outcome may have enabled us to include additional predictors, such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score, that did not have baseline measures for the ADNI 2 participants. With more predictors, we could have also implemented variable selection methods and/or regularization (i.e. LASSO and Ridge regression), in attempt to improve model fit and test accuracy. Third, a longer follow-up duration may better capture the true MCI reversions, given the slow progression of these cognitive changes in older individuals. We could have additionally examined MCI outcomes at 48 months and at the follow-up visits in ADNIGO. Future studies should validate these findings in a different population and can also develop a predictive model to determine predictors for the time to MCI reversion.
