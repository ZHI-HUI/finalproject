## 0. Problem Statement and Motivation 
In the current project, we plan to build and evaluate classification models to predict reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years using the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database. MCI is defined as a transitional state between normal cognition and dementia. Much of the existing literature has aimed to determine the predictors of conversion from MCI to dementia, however, many MCI patients do not progress to AD and up to 55% revert back to a cognitively normal state. It is therefore crucial to identify important predictors of a good prognosis among patients with MCI, which may inform intervention targets.

## 1. Introduction and Description of Data
MCI, a high risk condition for dementia, is regarded as a transitional state between cognitive normal	and dementia. Prevalence of MCI reversion to normal has varied widely, ranging from 4 to 55%, and multiple explanations are proposed for this variability, including individuals being misclassified initially, having unstable MCI, and having true improvements in cognitive functioning upon follow-up. Identifying which individuals classified as MCI are more likely to revert could help optimise resource allocation among MCI patients, with those considered least likely to revert receiving greater levels of intervention and follow-up contact. Therefore, the aim of this project is to build predictive model for MCI reversion using a wide range of predictors including socio-demographic, clinical, genetic, imaging characteristics, and biospecimen biomarkers. 

The goal of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study is to track the progression of the disease over different disease stages. The study has three phases: ADNI 1 (five years), ADNI GO (two years), and ADNI 2 (five years). We limited our analysis to ADNI1 participants since only patients with early MCI (EMCI) and/or late MCI (LMCI) were enrolled at baseline in ADNIGO and ADNI2 (Figure 1). Aggregating different definitions of MCI would lead to a heterogeneous outcome and subsequently poor and uninformative prediction models. The definition of MCI used by ADNI was based on the following criteria: (1) subjective memory complaint; (2) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30; (3) global Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5; (4) abnormal memory function; (5) did not meet AD criteria for deterioration in general cognitive and functional performance. After exclusion, 186 MCI patients that were followed for at least two years and did not develop AD within the time period were included for analyses.

## 2. Literature Review/Related Work 
Conversion from MCI to cognitively normal (CN) is commonly observed in the population, and several explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed in the existing literature. It has been reported that patients who revert from MCI to CN, or MCI-reverters, may have a temporary decline in cognitive functioning due to poor mental health (e.g. depression or stress related conditions/disorders) (Kumar, 2006; Olazaran, 2011) or physical health (Wisotsky, 1965). Others have postulated that these unstable MCI states are mis-labeled as MCI, and are in fact pre-MCI conditions that only develop to stable MCI under certain conditions or exposures (Petersen, 2011). Furthermore, it is possible that there are true causes of MCI that are reversible, such as metabolic disorders or acute conditions (e.g. brain injury, substance abuse) that may improve over time, leading to subsequent reversion back to CN. Lastly, pharmacological interventions, lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity, and baseline health may be true predictors of a better MCI prognosis (Olazaran, 2011). 

While it is of great importance to understand which individuals with MCI have a favorable prognosis, the literature in this area is sparse. Some studies have reported that cognitive factors and other measures used to diagnose MCI are significantly associated with MCI reversion (Manly, 2008; Diniz, 2009; Loewenstein, 2009; Ganguli, 2011; Olazaran, 2011; Dolcos, 2012;  Koepsell, 2012; Park 2015). Of the few studies that examined non-diagnostic factors (e.g. sociodemographic characteristics; physical and mental health), some found that age, educational attainment, arthritis, mental activity, better vision and smelling ability, and blood pressure drop was associated with MCI reversion (Tokuchi, 2014; Sachdev, 2013), but others did not find any associations (Koepsell, 2012). To the best of our knowledge, no study has set out to develop a prediction algorithm for MCI reversion to CN. Identifying individuals with diagnosed MCI, who have a high likelihood of reverting back to normal cognition can: (1) avoid unnecessary antidementia treatments, where the individual is exposed to potential side effects and health risks; (2) prevent the enrollment of clinical trial subjects who may only be in a temporary phase of cognitive decline, and do not in fact have the target disease (Koepsell, 2012). 
			
After a thorough literature review, potential diagnostic and non-diagnostic predictors of MCI reversion to CN were chosen a priori for preliminary EDA and prediction modeling for MCI reversion at two years from baseline. These factors have previously been implicated in either MCI reversion or conversion, and include the following: 
<br>
<br>
**1) Demographic characteristics:** age, gender, ethnicity, race, education, and marital status;<br>
**2) Clinical factors:** baseline blood glucose level, baseline homocysteine level, history of stroke, and history of hypertension (Sachdev, 2013);<br>
**3) Lifestyle factors:** baseline smoking and alcohol abuse;<br>
**4) Neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments:** baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) scores (including RAVLT Learning, Immediate Recall, and Percent Forgetting), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) Delayed Recognition score, AVLT Delayed Recall score, Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS) 11-item/13-item progression model, Trail Making Tests A and B, Animal Fluency Test, Clinical Dementia Rating score (CDR-SB), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (Ewer, 2012; Sachdev, 2013; Park, 2015). These tests assess different facets of cognitive performance, including daily functional ability, severity of cognitive impairment, verbal learning and fluency, and memory;
<br>
**5) Neuroimaging data:** baseline fluorodeoxyglucose 18F uptake on brain positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Park, 2015);<br>
**6) Biomarkers:** baseline Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β 1 to 42 peptide (Aβ42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau (Sachdev, 2013; Thomas, 2017; Park, 2015);<br>
**7) Genetic data:** APOE4 genotype (Sachdev, 2013; Thomas, 2017; Park, 2015).<br>


## 3. Modeling Approach and Project Trajectory 
Data was split into 60% training set and 40% test set. Models were built with the training set and compared with the baseline model of all 0’s classifier. MCI conversion to CN is a dichotomous response variable (0=stable MCI; 1=MCI-reversion to CN), and therefore only classification models that are appropriate for binary outcome were considered, including logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, and boosting classifier. Only predictors that appeared to be associated with MCI reversion in the EDA stage were carried forward to be included in the prediction model. Normalization was performed on the continuous predictors, and the optimal parameters for each of the classification models fitted were chosen using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. The proportion of MCI reversions in our sample was only 5.88%. Therefore, considering the unbalanced dataset, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated on the test set to assess the model performance. 

We had originally proposed to develop a machine learning model for predicting preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease. However, given the large number of post-baseline measures (including biomarkers and neuropsychological measures) required for the construction of the outcome definition, the sample that remained was too small for meaningful analysis. We therefore changed our outcome measure to MCI-reversion and aimed to develop machine learning solutions for predicting reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognitive functioning within 2 years.
 	
 				
## 4. Results, Conclusions, and Future Work 
Of the 186 participants with MCI at baseline, 13 (6.99%) reverted back to normal cognition after 2 years, which is consistent with the estimates reported in previous studies (Koepsell, 2012). 

Preliminary EDA was conducted on pre-selected predictors. For **demographic characteristics**, age was negatively associated with the probability of MCI reversion. The probability of MCI reversion was higher for females compared to males, and also higher for married people compared to unmarried people. For **clinical factors**, homocysteine level was positively associated with the probability of MCI reversion. For **lifestyle factors**, smokers are more likely to revert than non-smokers. For **neurocognitive assessments**, high RAVLT learning and immediate recall scores, AVLT delayed recognition and recall scores, animal frequency score, as well as low RAVLT forgetting and percent forgetting scores, ADAS 11 and 13 scores, trail making test A and B scores, were associated with higher probability of MCI reversion. Among these measures, RAVLT forgetting, percent forgetting, and AVLT delayed recall were strongly correlated, ADAS 11 and 13 were strongly correlated, and trail making test A and B were strongly correlated. For **neuroimaging assessments**, average FDG-PET at baseline was not associated with probability of MCI reversion. For **biomarkers**, higher beta-amyloid levels and lower tau and phosphoryated tau levels were associated with higher probability of MCI reversion. For **genetic markers**, increasing number of APOE4 copy was associated with lower probability of MCI reversion. 

Based on the EDA above, we select the following variables as potential predictors for modeling: **Demographic characteristics**: Age, Gender, and Marital Status; **Clinical factors**: Homocysteine level; **Lifestyle factors**: Baseline smoking; **Neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments**: RAVLT Immediate, RAVLT Learning, RAVLT Forgetting, ADAS13, TMT B, and Animal Fluency Score; **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Biomarkers**: amyloid-beta and tau; **Genetic factors**: APOE4 Status.

**Table 1**. Model performance based on true positive rate, false positive rate and AUC
![png](index_files/Table1.png)

Table 1 presents the performance of the six models that were tested. To compare the six models, we first used the true positive rate to evaluate a classifier's performance. Decision tree, random forest and adaboost performed better than the other models, since they had relatively higher TPR (0.67-1.00). A high true positive rate is important in identifying likely MCI-reverters so that patients do not receive unnecessary treatment for dementia. The false positive rate was low for all models (<0.01), which is crucial for preventing delayed treatment among those who will likely remain as MCI, and may subsequently progress to AD. We then compared the AUC on the test set for the three models with the highest TPR, and found that random forest had the highest test AUC. A high AUC is indicative of good discrimination between MCI-reverters and non-reverters. Therefore, we select the the random forest classifier with optimal number of predictors of 4 and optimal number of trees of 4 with the TPR of 0.67 and the highest test AUC of 0.88 as our final model. 

**Figure 2**. Feature importance from the random forest model
![png](index_files/Figure2.png)


From the feature importance analysis (**Figure 2**), we find that the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS13), age, Animal Fluency Test (CATANIMSC), and Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores (RAVLT  immediate, learning, and forgetting) were of greatest important in predicting MCI reversion to CN. Patients who are younger may be more likely to be experiencing temporary cognitive decline at baseline and thus more likely to regain cognitive abilities and revert to CN. Indeed, prior studies have shown that younger patients were more likely to revert to CN (Koepsell, 2012). The results also suggest that higher cognitive abilities at baseline in distinct domains were important predictors of MCI reversion. This included better episodic memory, as indicated by higher verbal learning (RAVLT Immediate and Learning), lower delayed memory (RAVLT Forgetting) scores; lower severity in cognitive impairment, as represented by lower ADAS13 scores; and better executive functioning and language skills, represented by higher Animal Fluency Test scores. This is in line with other studies that have similarly found that poorer cognitive performance is associated with MCI persistence or progression (Ganguli, 2011; Dolcos, 2012; Loewenstein, 2009). It is arguable that participants with borderline lowered cognitive performance who are still classified as MCI at baseline, may reflect temporary effects of confounding factors, such as depression or other medical illnesses. It is also possible that these neuropsychological measures are true predictors of MCI and/or AD progression and prognosis; in a recent study, Moradi et al. (Moradi, 2017) found that both RAVLT Immediate and Forgetting were strongly associated with structural brain atrophy in MRI scans. 

**Strengths**<br>
The current study has several strengths, including a consideration of a diverse range of neuropsychological, demographic, clinical, and biomarker factors that were measured using standardized assessments and protocols, and consideration of multiple classification models including logistic regression, LDA, KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, and boosting classifier. Our study is also the first to develop a machine learning model to predict MCI reversion to normal. 

**Limitations**<br>
Our study has several limitations that should be considered in interpreting the results. First, the follow-up duration of two years was relatively short, therefore, the study time frame may have been insufficient to completely capture all MCI reversions to CN. Second, we restricted our analysis to those who had MCI at baseline, complete data on all predictors at baseline, and a follow-up diagnostic classification at the two-year follow-up. This may limit the generalizability of our results, if the individuals who were lost to follow-up were different from individuals remained in the analyses. Also, many predictors reported in previous studies had to be dropped from our modeling process due to a large number of missing values at baseline and/or lack of data collection in either ADNI 1 or ADNI 2, such as neuropsychological measures (including Trail Making Test and one measure of AVLT), diabetes, and neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire score (NPIQ). Finally, ADNI does not routinely collect information on important variables such as lifestyle factors (e.g. physical activity, diet), social interaction and/or support, and personality traits, which may be predictive of MCI reversion rates. 

**Future work**<br>
In light of the short-comings of the current study, we propose several methods that could have improved our project and possible extensions of the work. First, we had excluded from our models individuals who did not have complete data on baseline predictors, which largely reduced our final analytic sample size. Given a longer time frame, we would have performed imputation on those missing values, using a model-based approach. Second, we considered only predictors at baseline, and did not assess how measures of these predictors at other time points prior to the two year point or changes in these measures over time could improve the prediction accuracy. Using post-baseline measures that were taken prior to our outcome may have enabled us to include additional predictors, such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score, that did not have baseline measures for the study participants. With more predictors, we could have also implemented variable selection methods and/or regularization (i.e. LASSO and Ridge regression), in attempt to improve model fit and test accuracy. Third, a longer follow-up duration may better capture the true MCI reversions, given the slow progression of these cognitive changes in older individuals. We could have additionally examined MCI outcomes at 48 months and at the follow-up visits in ADNIGO. Future studies should validate these findings in a different population and can also develop a predictive model to determine predictors for the time to MCI reversion. Finally, given sufficient sample size it may be of interest to compare the important predictors of MCI reversion to normal cognition to those of MCI conversion to AD. 

In conclusion, we have developed a machine learning model, specifically random forest, that provides good prediction accuracy for MCI-reversion to CN over a 2-year period. The top predictors were age, and various neuropsychological measures, including RAVLT scores, ADAS13, and Animal Fluency Test. These predictors can be easily collected by physicians at low cost, and are non-invasive. Therefore, this model can potentially be applied to clinical settings to predict individuals with diagnosed MCI who are more or less likely to revert to normal cognition in two years. Based on these predictions, healthcare resources and patient attention can be optimally delegated to those who are less likely to revert, and also prevent unnecessary anti-dementia treatments who are likely to recover to normal cognition over time.
